Ecoleta was a project developed during Rocketseat's NLW#01

## About

  <p>Ecoleta is an aggregator of collection points for recyclable products, in which people can register known collection points and what materials they collect, so that other people who have access to the mobile app can get to know them</p>

## Technologies involved

  <p>Ecoleta was developed using only Typescript (JavaScript) as a programming language. Thus, Node.js was used to build the backend, using some libraries as an auxiliary, Express.js for example. The Frontend was built with React.js and the mobile with React Native, making use of Expo to facilitate development.</p>
